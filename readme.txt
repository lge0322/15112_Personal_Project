My term project's name is "Woodboy and Metalgirl." It's a collaborative game where
two players each use separate keyboard sets to play the game. It is based off upon 
the original game called "Fireboy and Watergirl" and is similiar in a way that 
players need to avoid obstacles and collect gems to open the door to escape the maze.
For this game, specifically, I have mainly implemented the maze generation, the 
hint system, level generation, and pygame.

This zip folder contains several types of files from python to mp3. If you want
to run the tkinter app, please open the python file called "_1_classes.py." All the 
other python files are imported to the main file. Also, if you have not yet downloaded
pygame module, a pythone file called "module manager" will guide you to download 
pygame as pygame is imported in the main file.

+ When playing the game, the woodboy player uses keyboards 'a', 'w', 'd', 's', whereas
Metalgirl player does so with the arrow keys.
